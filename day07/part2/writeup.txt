# Day 7: Part 2 

## Problem Description
In this part, the goal was to find the smallest directory that meets certain size criteria. This required a more detailed analysis of the directory sizes calculated in Part 1.

## Approach
To tackle this problem, I followed these steps:
1. **Reuse Previous Logic**: I reused the tree structure and size calculation logic from Part 1 to maintain consistency.
2. **Identify Smallest Directory**: I traversed the tree again, checking the sizes of directories to find the smallest one that meets the specified criteria.
3. **Output**: Finally, I printed the size of the smallest directory that meets the criteria.

This approach builds on the previous logic while adding the complexity of finding the smallest directory.

## Key Insights
- Extending existing data structures can simplify the implementation of new requirements.
- Efficient searching algorithms are key to performance.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Trees for representing file systems.
- **Algorithms**: Recursive traversal for size calculation and searching for the smallest directory.
