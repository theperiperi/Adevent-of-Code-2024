# Day 15: Part 2 

## Problem Description
In this part, the goal was to extend the signal processing logic to accommodate additional criteria for evaluation. The new criteria may involve more complex relationships between signals, requiring a more sophisticated approach.

## Approach
To tackle this problem, I followed these steps:
1. **Reuse Previous Logic**: I reused the signal processing logic from Part 1 to maintain consistency.
2. **Adjust Processing Criteria**: I modified the logic for calculating signal strength to reflect the new criteria. This may involve additional conditions or different calculations.
3. **Total Strength Calculation**: I iterated through the list of signals again, applying the updated criteria to compute the total strength.
4. **Output**: Finally, I printed the total strength based on the new criteria.

This approach builds on the previous logic while adding the complexity of the new evaluation criteria.

## Key Insights
- Extending existing logic can be done efficiently by building on previous implementations.
- Clear documentation of new criteria is essential for maintaining code clarity.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Variables for tracking signal strengths.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and strength calculation with adjusted criteria.
