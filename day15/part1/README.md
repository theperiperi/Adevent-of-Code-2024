# Day 15: Part 1 - [Problem Name]

## Problem Description
The task was to analyze a sequence of signals and determine the strength of each signal based on specific criteria. Each signal is represented by a value, and the goal is to compute a total strength based on the defined rules.

## Approach
To solve this problem, I implemented the following steps:
1. **Input Reading**: I read the input data from a file, which contains a list of signal values.
2. **Signal Processing**: I iterated through the list of signals, applying the defined criteria to compute the strength of each signal.
3. **Total Strength Calculation**: I maintained a running total of the strengths calculated for each signal.
4. **Output**: Finally, I printed the total strength after processing all signals.

This approach effectively evaluates the strength of signals based on the specified criteria.

## Key Insights
- Using a structured approach to signal processing can simplify the logic.
- Efficiently managing calculations is key to performance.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Variables for tracking signal strengths.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and strength calculation based on criteria.
