# Day 9: Part 2 

## Problem Description
In this part, the goal was to extend the simulation to track multiple positions based on the same commands. This required maintaining the state of multiple entities moving simultaneously.

## Approach
To tackle this problem, I followed these steps:
1. **Reuse Previous Logic**: I reused the command processing logic from Part 1 to maintain consistency.
2. **Track Multiple Positions**: I modified the implementation to maintain a list of positions, allowing for the tracking of multiple entities.
3. **Command Processing**: I iterated through each command again, applying the same logic to update the positions of all entities.
4. **Output**: Finally, I printed the positions of all entities after processing all commands.

This approach efficiently tracks multiple positions while building on the existing logic.

## Key Insights
- Extending existing logic can be done efficiently by building on previous implementations.
- Clear documentation of tracking rules is essential for maintaining code clarity.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Lists for tracking multiple positions.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and position updating based on commands.
