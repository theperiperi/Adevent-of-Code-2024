# Day 9: Part 1 - [Problem Name]

## Problem Description
The task was to simulate a series of movements based on input commands and determine the final position. Each command specifies a direction and distance to move.

## Approach
To solve this problem, I implemented the following steps:
1. **Input Reading**: I read the input data from a file, which contains a list of movement commands.
2. **Coordinate System**: I used a simple coordinate system to track the position, starting from an initial point (0, 0).
3. **Command Processing**: I iterated through each command, updating the position based on the specified direction and distance.
4. **Output**: Finally, I printed the final position after processing all commands.

This approach effectively simulates the movements as described.

## Key Insights
- Using a simple coordinate system can simplify the logic for tracking positions.
- Efficiently processing commands is key to maintaining performance.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Variables for tracking coordinates.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and position updating based on commands.
