# Day 14: Part 2 - [Problem Name]

## Problem Description
In this part, the goal was to extend the simulation to accommodate additional rules for processing. The new rules may change how operations are applied to the collection, affecting the final state.

## Approach
To tackle this problem, I followed these steps:
1. **Reuse Previous Logic**: I reused the collection representation and input reading logic from Part 1 to maintain consistency.
2. **Adjust Operation Rules**: I modified the logic for processing operations to reflect the new rules. This may involve changing how items are added, removed, or modified based on the new criteria.
3. **Operation Processing**: I iterated through the list of operations again, applying the updated rules to calculate the final state of the collection.
4. **Output**: Finally, I printed the adjusted final state of the collection.

This approach maintains clarity by building on the existing logic while incorporating the new rules.

## Key Insights
- Extending existing logic can be done efficiently by building on previous implementations.
- Clear documentation of new rules is essential for maintaining code clarity.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Lists or dictionaries for representing collections.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and simulation of operations with adjusted rules.
