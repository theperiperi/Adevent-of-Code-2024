# Day 14: Part 1 

## Problem Description
The challenge was to analyze a sequence of operations and determine the final state of a collection based on specific criteria. Each operation modifies the collection in a defined manner, and the goal is to compute the final state after all operations are applied.

## Approach
To solve this problem, I implemented the following steps:
1. **Input Reading**: I read the input data from a file, which contains a list of operations to perform on the collection.
2. **Collection Representation**: I initialized a data structure (e.g., a list or dictionary) to represent the collection's state.
3. **Operation Processing**: I iterated through each operation, updating the collection according to the specified rules for modification.
4. **Output**: Finally, I printed the final state of the collection after processing all operations.

This approach effectively simulates the operations as described.

## Key Insights
- Using a simulation approach can effectively model complex behaviors.
- Efficiently managing state transitions is key to performance.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Lists or dictionaries for representing collections.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and simulation of operations.
