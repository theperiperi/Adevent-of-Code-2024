# Day 8: Part 2 

## Problem Description
In this part, the goal was to calculate a score based on the visibility of elements in the grid. The score is determined by the number of visible elements and their respective heights.

## Approach
To tackle this problem, I followed these steps:
1. **Reuse Previous Logic**: I reused the visibility checking logic from Part 1 to maintain consistency.
2. **Score Calculation**: I modified the visibility checking logic to calculate a score based on the heights of the visible elements.
3. **Output**: Finally, I printed the total score based on the visibility of elements.

This approach builds on the previous logic while adding the complexity of scoring.

## Key Insights
- Reusing existing logic can save time and reduce errors.
- Clear documentation of scoring rules is essential for maintaining code clarity.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Two-dimensional lists for representing grids.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and visibility checking with scoring.
