# Day 3: Part 1 - [Problem Name]

## Problem Description
The challenge was to analyze a set of strings and determine the most common character in each string. The goal was to identify which character appears most frequently and return that character.

## Approach
To solve this problem, I implemented the following steps:
1. **Input Reading**: I read the input data from a file, which contains multiple strings.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string, I used a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character. This allows for efficient tracking of character frequencies.
3. **Determine Most Common Character**: After counting the characters, I used the `max()` function with a custom key to find the character with the highest frequency.
4. **Output**: Finally, I printed the most common character for each string.

This approach is efficient and leverages Python's strengths in handling dictionaries and string operations.

## Key Insights
- Using dictionaries to count occurrences is an effective way to track data.
- Python's `max()` function can be utilized with a custom key to find the most common character efficiently.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Dictionaries for counting character occurrences.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and finding the maximum frequency character.
