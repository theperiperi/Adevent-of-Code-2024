# Day 11: Part 1 - [Problem Name]

## Problem Description
The task was to simulate a series of operations on a collection of items and determine the final state. Each operation specifies how items should be moved or modified.

## Approach
To solve this problem, I implemented the following steps:
1. **Input Reading**: I read the input data from a file, which contains the initial configuration of items and the operations to perform.
2. **Collection Representation**: I used a list or dictionary to represent the collection of items, allowing for easy access and modification.
3. **Operation Processing**: I iterated through the list of operations, updating the collection according to the specified rules for moving or modifying items.
4. **Output**: Finally, I printed the final configuration of the collection after all operations were applied.

This approach effectively simulates the operations as described.

## Key Insights
- Using a simulation approach can effectively model complex behaviors.
- Efficiently managing state transitions is key to performance.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Lists or dictionaries for representing collections.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and simulation of operations.
