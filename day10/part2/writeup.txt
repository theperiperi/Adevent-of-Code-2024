# Day 10: Part 2 

## Problem Description
In this part, the goal was to extend the logic to calculate additional metrics based on the final state of the register. The new metrics provide further insights into the operations performed.

## Approach
To tackle this problem, I followed these steps:
1. **Reuse Previous Logic**: I reused the state machine logic from Part 1 to maintain consistency.
2. **Calculate Additional Metrics**: I added logic to compute the new metrics based on the final state of the register.
3. **Output**: Finally, I printed the additional metrics alongside the final state of the register.

This approach builds on the previous logic while adding the complexity of calculating new metrics.

## Key Insights
- Reusing existing logic can save time and reduce errors.
- Clear documentation of new metrics is essential for maintaining code clarity.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Variables for representing the register.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and state management with additional calculations.
