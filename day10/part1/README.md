# Day 10: Part 1 

## Problem Description
The challenge was to analyze a sequence of operations and determine the final state of a register. Each operation modifies the register based on specific rules.

## Approach
To solve this problem, I implemented the following steps:
1. **Input Reading**: I read the input data from a file, which contains a list of operations to perform on the register.
2. **Register Representation**: I initialized a variable to represent the register's state.
3. **Operation Processing**: I iterated through each operation, updating the register according to the specified rules.
4. **Output**: Finally, I printed the final state of the register after processing all operations.

This approach effectively simulates the operations as described.

## Key Insights
- Using a state machine can simplify the logic for processing operations.
- Efficiently managing state transitions is key to performance.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Variables for representing the register.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and state management based on operations.
