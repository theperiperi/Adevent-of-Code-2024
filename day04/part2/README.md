# Day 4: Part 2 - [Problem Name]

## Problem Description
In this part, the goal was to count the number of ranges that fully contain another range. This required a more detailed comparison of the start and end points of each range.

## Approach
To tackle this problem, I followed these steps:
1. **Reuse Previous Logic**: I reused the range parsing logic from Part 1 to maintain consistency.
2. **Containment Checking**: I iterated through each pair of ranges, checking if one range fully contains another by comparing their start and end points.
3. **Count Containments**: I maintained a count of how many ranges fully contain another and printed the final count.

This approach builds on the previous logic while adding the complexity of full containment checks.

## Key Insights
- Full containment checks require careful comparison of both endpoints.
- Reusing existing logic can simplify the implementation.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Tuples for representing ranges.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and comparison for containment checking.
