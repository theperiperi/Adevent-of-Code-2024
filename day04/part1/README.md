# Day 4: Part 1 - [Problem Name]

## Problem Description
The challenge was to determine the number of overlapping ranges from a list of pairs. Each pair represents a range, and the goal is to count how many of these ranges overlap with each other.

## Approach
To solve this problem, I implemented the following steps:
1. **Input Reading**: I read the input data from a file, which contains pairs of ranges.
2. **Range Parsing**: I parsed the input to extract the start and end points of each range, storing them in a list of tuples.
3. **Overlap Checking**: I iterated through each pair of ranges, checking if they overlap by comparing their start and end points.
4. **Count Overlaps**: I maintained a count of how many ranges overlap and printed the final count.

This approach is straightforward and effectively checks for overlaps.

## Key Insights
- Efficiently checking for overlaps can be done by comparing the endpoints of ranges.
- Using tuples to represent ranges simplifies the logic.

## Concepts and Algorithms Used
- **Input Handling**: Reading from files and processing strings.
- **Data Structures**: Tuples for representing ranges.
- **Algorithms**: Iteration and comparison for overlap checking.
